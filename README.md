# Testing-Money-Clicker
My first 'project' an extremely simple, poorly made 'clicker' game. This was made to help me understand the use of signals and I hope to improve this project as I learn more about Game Dev and Godot.

I wanted to understand the use of signals and how they are able to communicate information. In this instance I used signals to communicate the health and money variables from the health script to the shop and money scripts. I believe I made it extremely sloppily however at the moment I do not know of any other way to do it. I am just starting out with game development and I think I did a good job knowing what i know.

My goal is to continually update this project as I improve and hopefully in a few years when I hopefully become proficient in Game development I will have a completed game that I technically started from my very first days of learning Godot and Game Development.
I am writing this for my future self and Supposedly anyone interested enough in my projects if I do become a known figure later.
